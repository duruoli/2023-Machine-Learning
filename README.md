# 2023-Machine-Learning
Class Project, Recommender Systems, Neural Networks, Interpretability


# Content
*Each Project file contains code and report, while some of them also include data*

1. Project1: data preprocessing, i.e., data wrangling and EDA
2. Project2: recommender systems
   - popularity matching
   - content filtering
   - collaborative filtering
3. Project3: predictive models
   - linear model
   - random forest
   - neural networks
   - transfer learning, i.e., generalization
   - visualization in map
4. Project4: interpretability
   - tabular data: weights, feature importance for rf, LIME(kind of "local linear interpretation")
   - image data(Animal_10N): SmoothGrad(i.e., gradient sensitivity map), LIME
